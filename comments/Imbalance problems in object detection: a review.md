# [Imbalance Problems in Object Detection: A Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00169.pdf)

**Problem**: Object detection is one of the most important and challenging branches of computer vision. This paper surveys the most prominent imbalance problems.

**Notes**:
* Imbalance problems can be one of four kinds: **Class imbalance**, **Scale imbalance**, **Spatial imbalance**, **objective imbalance**.
* Class imbalance: occurs when a certain class is over-represented. (often fixed by over-/undersampling)
* Scale imbalance is observed when object instances have various scales and different number of examples pertaining to different scales.
* 
* Objective imbalance occurs when there are multiple objectives (loss
functions) to minimize (each for a specific task, e.g. classifi-
cation and box-regression).
