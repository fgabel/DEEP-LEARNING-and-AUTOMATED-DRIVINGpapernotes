# Towards spike-based machine intelligence with neuromorphic computing

**TL;DR** Spike-based neural networks resemble the brain much more closely. This article makes a strong case for enabling machine intelligence through synergistic advancements in both hardware (computing) and algorithms (intelligence)


* The below Figure shows historical and future milestones in hardware and architecture, leading towards AI and neuromorphic computing.

* There are datasets that contain annotations in 2D (either semantic/instance segmentation or 2D object detection i.e. bounding boxes) or 3D (mostly 3D object detection with 9 degrees of freedom. This [nice paper from Bosch](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07830.pdf) subsumes these conclusively:

* Even more sensoric information can be used if both 3D and 2D data are available. This [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07864v1.pdf) lists all datasets that can be used as such:
