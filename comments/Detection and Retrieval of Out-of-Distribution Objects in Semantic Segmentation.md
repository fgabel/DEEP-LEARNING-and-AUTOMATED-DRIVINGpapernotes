# [Detection and Retrieval of Out-of-Distribution Objects in Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06831.pdf)

**Problem**: Out-of-distribution objects in semantic segmentation are hard to detect as they are unbeknownst to the training mechanism by definition. Also, there is a strict latency requirement for certain scenarios such as autonomous driving.
